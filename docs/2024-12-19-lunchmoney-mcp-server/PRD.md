# Lunch Money MCP Server - Product Requirements Document

## What are we building?

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables Large Language Models to interact with the Lunch Money personal finance API through natural language queries and commands.

## Why are we building it?

**Problem:** Users need to manually navigate the Lunch Money web interface to analyze their financial data, which is time-consuming and limits accessibility for AI-assisted financial insights.

**Solution:** Enable users to ask their AI assistant natural language questions like "How much did I spend on groceries last month?" or "Which transactions look miscategorized?" and get instant, accurate responses.

**Business Value:**

- Improves user experience by making financial data more accessible
- Leverages existing AI assistants users already trust
- Differentiates our integration capabilities in the AI ecosystem
- Reduces friction for financial data analysis

## What does success look like?

**Phase 1 Success Metrics:**

- Successfully connect to Lunch Money API with proper authentication
- Handle basic read operations (accounts, transactions, categories)
- Support 3-5 common user queries with accurate responses

**Full Success Metrics:**

- Support all major Lunch Money API endpoints
- Enable both read and write operations
- Process complex financial analysis queries
- Handle edge cases and errors gracefully
- Ready for production use with AI assistants

**User Success:**

- Users can ask natural language questions about their finances
- AI provides accurate, contextual responses
- No need to switch between AI assistant and Lunch Money app

### Why now?

MCP protocol adoption is accelerating with Cursor and Claude Pro native
support, making chat-based financial tools accessible to the growing
developer community already using Lunch Money for personal finance tracking.

## ðŸŽ¯ Solution & Scope

### What are we building?

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects to the Lunch Money API
through standard I/O, enabling instant natural language financial analysis
within any MCP-compatible chat client.

### What does success look like?es-it-work)

--- ] **1.** Reduce time to get spending insights from 15+ minutes to under
30 seconds

## ðŸ“‹ Context & Opportunity

### User & Context response time under 2 seconds for all financial calculations

### Anti-Goals (What we're NOT building)

- NOT building budget modification or expense creation capabilities
- NOT building expense categorization or transaction editing features
- NOT supporting bulk transaction imports or data exports
- NOT creating a standalone financial analysis dashboard

### Key Assumptions & Risks

1. **Biggest Risk:** Lunch Money API rate limits could prevent real-time
   queries for active users
2. **User Assumption:** Users will adopt chat-based financial queries over
   familiar web UI navigation

### What problem are we solving? standard I/O can reliably handle complex

financial data parsing and categorization

  categories, and returns total with breakdown
- **When** they ask "What's my average electricity bill for 6 months?"
- **Then** server analyzes utility transactions and calculates precise
  monthly average

**Smart Category Intelligence**

### Anti-Goals (What we're NOT building)

- **Given** broad category queries like "food" or "transportation"
- NOT building budget modification or expense creation capabilities
- NOT building expense categorization or transaction editing features
- NOT supporting bulk transaction imports or data exports
